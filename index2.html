     <h1>Ireland</h1>
     <p>When I was in college I was offerd a chande to travle to Ireland, 
       and it was one of the best experiances of my life.This was my first trip 
       across the pond, and it was a memorable one. While in country we visited a
        number of famous places Guinnuss at st. james gate, St. Patrick Cathedral,
         Trinity college and Waterford Glass to name a few.  However, two places
          that had a lasting impression were <b>The Cliffs of Mohr</b> 
          and <b>Glendalough</b>.

      <h1>London</h1>
      <p>The very next year I had the pleasure of doing it all over again thanks to
        my College.  This time we would go to both Dublin Ireland and London England.
        I had been to Dublin before, but London was new and a city that I had always
         wanted to visit. In London we did the usual touristy bits big bend, 
         Westminster abbey, Buckingham palace, Hyde Park and of course a stop at Kings 
         Cross station to visit platform 9 3/4.  However, if you are ever in London
         you cannot miss the British museum.  While their field museum does have some
        the best complete Dinosaur skeletons, you cannot miss the British museum.  
        These hallowed halls house some of the largest collections of ancient artifacts
        in the world. From Egypt, Rome, and even the Rosetta stone. But the one that
          stands out here are the Elgin marbles, which are better known as the Parthenon
          Marbles.  They were stolen, according to the Greeks by Lord Elgin in the 1800s
           from the Temple of Athena in Athens.  No matter your interest London is a 
           great city to visit.</p>

      <h1>Italy</h1>
      <p>Here you see the Coliseum of Rome While it is arguably one of the most
        Iconic symbols of the world It is far from the most iconic in Rome.
        However seeing this landmark in person allowed me to start on of my
       life long goals.  This was my first of the Seven Wonders of the World,
      and I am Ecstatic to visit more of them.<br><br> while in Italy we saw much more
      than just Rome.  We Travled to Venice, Pisa, and Pompeii.  All of which I recomend to any
      Traveler, but Italy should not be enjoed without a visit to Rome and Venice. While there is 
      a lot of History in cities like Milan and Florance, I believe that Rome and Venice 
      are the most important if you are limited on time, and if in Rome the ruins of Pompeii is a 
     simple day trip. But If you have the time make sure to hit all of these cities,
     either way you will not be disapointed in Italy even if you get stuck in one city. 
     Personaly I look forward to returing to Italy to see even more, and enjoy the food of course.
